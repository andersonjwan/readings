# Chapter 9: Strings and Regular Expressions

## Questions

- What is a bidirectional iterator?

## Notes

- Strings are mutable.
- For complete portability of regular expression patterns, use the character class names (e.g., `[[:digit:]]`) over their respective abbreviations (e.g., `\d`).
- Rely on returning strings by value over reference.
