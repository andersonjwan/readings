a) The advantages of a compiler over an interpreter is that a compiler completely
   translates the source language to the target language, so when running inputs
   on the translated program, it is considered more efficient and faster.

b) The advantage(s) of an interpreter of a compiler is that an interpreter can
   usually output better error diagnostics due to its simultaneous translation
   and execution on the inputs resulting in more accurate errors.
