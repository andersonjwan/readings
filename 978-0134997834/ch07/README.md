## Notes

- "It is not a good idea to try to 'abstract' by trying to prepare for every conceivable need and technique; in that direction lies inelegance and code bloat. Instead, start with one – and preferably more – concrete examples from real use and try to eliminate inessential details."
- Best, most reliable method to develop a template is: (1) write a concrete version, (2) debug, test, and measure, and (3) replace concrete types with template arguments.

## Definitions

- Lifting: The process of generalizing from a concrete piece of code (preferably several) while preserving performance.
