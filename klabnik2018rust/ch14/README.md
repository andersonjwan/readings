# Chapter 14: More About Cargo and Crates.io

This chapter focused on introducing more concepts related to crates.io and Cargo. This included release profiles, how to setup a crates.io account and publish packages, the power of Cargo workspaces, installing Cargo binaries, and extending the Cargo command.

## Notes

- There are two types of item documentation comments: (1) functions, structs (i.e., items that precede the documentation comment) and (2) crates and modules (i.e., container-based items).
- Re-exporting is important to help users quickly identify the important components of the library without having to dig through the documentation and module tree.
- A list of valid license identifiers for the `Cargo.toml` file can be found at [https://spdx.org/licenses/](https://spdx.org/licenses/).
