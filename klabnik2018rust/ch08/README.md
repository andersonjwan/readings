# Chapter 8: Common Collections

This chapter covered some standard data structures from the `std::collections` module. This included an overview of Vectors, Strings, and Hash Maps. The most noteworthy mention from the chapter is that Strings in Rust are not handled the same as strings in other languages due to the inherit support for UTF-8 data.

## Notes

- Slicing a String does not guarantee safe behavior (i.e., a character may be represented with more than one byte).

## ToDo

- Look into the Vector API
- Look into the OsString, OsStr, CString, and CStr API
