# Chapter 2: Programming a Guessing Game

This chapter provides a hands-on demonstration of Rust features and a preview of its capabilities. While developing a simple number guessing, managing and using external crates with Cargo and understanding associated functions, the match operation, and simple error handling is covered.

## Notes

- Associated functions are implemented on a type (i.e., they can be correlated to static methods in other programming languages).
- The `let` keyword allows for type inference on variables
- The `match` operation allows for complex in-code pattern matching and is commonly used for error handling.

## Questions

- Do methods act on traits? Or, do traits implements methods? Or, are they properties of structs?
