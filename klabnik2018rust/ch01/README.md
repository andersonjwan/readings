# Chapter 1: Getting Started

This chapter covers the basic preliminaries involved with developing in Rust. This includes covering a basic program, compilation using `rustc`, and using the Rust build system: Cargo.

## Notes

- When compiling, Rust will compile a debuggable version first. Therefore, when releasing binaries, be sure to use the `--release` flag for Cargo to build an optimized binary.
