# Readings
The purpose of this repository is to store my related textbook reading exercise solutions and any other additional information related to the textbook (e.g., notes, links, resources).

I use an **ISBN**-based naming convention for the folders to reduce clutter and keep uniformity; also, I doubt this will be used by a larger community, so it works for me. Please see the [legend](https://github.com/andersonjwan/readings/blob/main/README.md#legend) below for a more "useful" interface to search for books.

## Legend
See the legend below for mapping ISBNs to book titles&mdash;organized alphabetically by book title. In addition, each book "location" should have its own information detailing exercises and general navigation.
