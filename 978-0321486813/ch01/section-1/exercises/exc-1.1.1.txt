The difference between a compiler and an interpreter relies fundamentally the
relationship between when the source language is translated and when the inputs /
outputs are processed. In a compiler, the source language is completely
translated to its target language, and then the processing of inputs / outputs
can be performed. In an interpreter, the source language is translated whenever
inputs are to be run on it by the user.
